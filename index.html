                        <h3>Transforming Mental Health: Bee Hive's Lifeline to Recovery and Support</h3>
                        <p>The onset of a mental health crisis is all-encompassing and most of us feel totally alone in
                            our venture to do the right next thing to control the disease and create a positive outcome.
                            Most don’t know where to start beyond seeking mental health hospitalization or therapeutic
                            treatment. A big part of our mission is to help people from the moment of onset, to identify
                            the right next steps once a patient is medically stable (likely in ER or in an acute-care
                            psychiatric hospital). By providing a helping hand to the person affected and their
                            caregivers we aim to increase the odds of the victim having a lifetime of positive recovery.
                            That’s not usually what happens today.</p>

                        <p>Much like a bee colony, we are a group of people who seek to build brand awareness (a hive)
                            for today’s mental health crisis and provide ongoing support to those living with their
                            loved ones.</p>

                        <p><span>Bee There will be the link between mental and addiction care services providers and/ or
                                professional support service between these organizations and those affected.</span></p>

                        <p>The social aspect of the Bee Hives will provide a place for those of “like diagnosis” to
                            gather and support each other. And to pollinate! Spreading their wings and sharing their
                            pollen from place to place and person to person.
                        </p>

                        <p>We plan to help minimize the horror and feelings of being completely lost that come with
                            these dreaded, often lifetime diagnoses by providing a playbook and roadmap to those in
                            desperate need of unbiased, noncommercial assistance. We seek not to replace existing mental
                            health support organizations but to complement their efforts and enhance their results by
                            increasing their reach and promoting their brands.</p>

                        <p>Bee Hive and its communities will provide conversation, research, education, and search. We
                            are transparent and unbiased.</p>

                        <p><b>We believe that healing is aligned with the principles of spirituality and God.</b></p>

                            <p>Through it all, many helped me as much as they could. Still, it’s like a big complicated
                                spider web to maneuver, always trying to dodge the crippling venom of the next onslaught
                                of an episode. Today my son is a high-functioning, peaceful, and largely happy and
                                productive member of society. While he still struggles to deal with his illness and is
                                still fighting his diagnosis, he is taking his meds–to those who have never experienced
                                mental health disease up close, that may seem like an obvious. Believe me, it is not.
                                Acceptance may be the hardest obstacle to recovery for those affected by mental illness.
                                Fear and Forgiveness may be the strongest battle those who care and love them have to
                                face and endure. Bee There was founded on the belief that there is a missing link to
                                mental health awareness, support and care. We hope to change that.</p>

                            battle with
                            medical, legal, financial, and societal barriers to being there and loving someone who is
                            mentally ill. Often people with mental illness also suffer from addiction and other
                            co-occurring disorders, which can complicate their treatment, recovery, and support network.
                            We plan to build a local, state, and national network and global brand that people like
                            <b>Peggy</b> and her son will know they can turn to on Day 1.
